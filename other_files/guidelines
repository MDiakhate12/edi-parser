always set default factory
never define simple SegmentGroup type field if it can match multiple segments in the EDI
If not sure if your segment field can have one or multiple values, set it to List[YourSegmentGroupType] or List[YourSegmentType]
field regex of segment groups are built based on field names
    consequence : alway define field names of a segment group with a name that matches the segment name (at least the 3 first characters of the field name, in upper case)
segment group fields should always be one of these three type : List[AnySegmentGroupSubtype] List[AnySegmentSubtype] AnySegmentGroupSubtype or AnySegmentSubtype
